# Terms & Conditions / Privacy Policy  
*Published by ClearCraft Solutions | Updated May 2025*

At **ClearCraft Solutions**, we take a straightforward approach to partnerships, projects, and privacy. This page outlines our general terms of engagement and how we handle data. It’s designed to be clear, fair, and honest — just like the work we do.

---

## Engagement Philosophy

ClearCraft Solutions is a small, focused development studio. We take on only a limited number of projects at any given time, and we do so with intention. Every engagement is evaluated not just for feasibility, but for fit — with our process, our principles, and our long-term direction.  
**Working with us is selective by design**. This ensures that every project receives the full attention of a tight-knit team of highly skilled developers.

## Ownership of Work

Unless explicitly negotiated in writing *prior to project commencement*, all software, tools, models, and source code developed by ClearCraft Solutions — including those produced under contract — are considered the sole proprietary property of ClearCraft Solutions.  
This includes but is not limited to:
- Application source code
- Proprietary logic or algorithms
- AI models or data pipelines
- Internal tooling and libraries

Clients are granted a license to use the deliverables per the terms of their agreement, but **ownership remains with us by default** unless otherwise specified.

If full transfer of rights is desired, this **must be negotiated separately** and may involve additional fees and licensing terms.

## Liability & Responsibility

We stand behind the quality of our craftsmanship — but we do not promise perfection, nor do we accept liability for unintended outcomes, damages, or losses resulting from the use of our software or services.

All deliverables are provided **as-is**, with no guarantees of fitness for a particular purpose unless otherwise outlined in a written agreement. Any reliance on our software is at your own discretion and risk.

Support and maintenance are available **only by arrangement**, and not implied by default.

## Privacy & Data

ClearCraft Solutions does not collect or retain unnecessary data from clients, collaborators, or site visitors. We do not use tracking scripts, analytics pixels, or third-party advertising integrations.

If you contact us, your information will only be used to respond to you directly. We do not sell, trade, or share your data. We believe in digital privacy — for ourselves and for those we work with.

## Code of Engagement

By working with us, you acknowledge and accept the following:

- You are engaging a **selective, premium development partner**, not a generic vendor.
- Communication will be clear, concise, and expectations mutual.
- We may decline a project for any reason, including scope, timeline, or alignment.
- We will treat your time and ideas with respect — and expect the same in return.

Thank you for considering ClearCraft Solutions.  
We don’t chase volume — we pursue clarity, purpose, and excellence in every line of code.
